# Pong
Simple Pong game using SDL

This is the first game that I create using SDL. 
It is possible that some things are not done in the optimal form.

It requires the next dependencies:
SDL2.lib
SDL2main.lib
SDL2_ttf.lib
SDL2_image.lib

It is published in itch.io, in the following link: https://godsello.itch.io/pong
